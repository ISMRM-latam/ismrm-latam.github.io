(v) To promote opportunities for collaboration between professionals of magneticresonance in medicine and biology working or studying in Latin America and professionals working or studying in the rest of the world, especially those with Latin American roots.

(vi) To provide information and advice on magnetic resonance in medicine and biologyand other related topics, to interested organizations from all sectors, including local, regional and national governments.

(vii) To cooperate with local, regional, and national authorities as well as academicorganizations, public or private institutions in Latin America to achieve the aforementioned objectives.

# 2\. Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Policy

The Chapter is open to all those working or studying in the field of magnetic resonance in medicine and biology. The Chapter recognizes and supports good scientific work regardless of any characteristics of personal identity such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, disability, religion, sexual orientation, education, socio-economic background, language, political beliefs, or age.

The Chapter is dedicated to equal opportunities and has zero tolerance for discrimination or harassment.

# 3\. 3-year Governance Plan

The Latin American Chapter of the ISMRM will hold a three-day annual scientific meeting at a location within Latin America, starting in 2025, and alternating between the macrozones defined in the ByLaws (4.1) to promote local attendance. A local organizing committee will be established each year as detailed in the ByLaws (4.0 Governance) to plan the scientific meeting with the support of the Executive Committee. Hybrid and virtual options will be considered as well, to promote attendance from remote locations and countries with financial challenges.

Given the affiliations and connections of the Executive Committee, for the next three years, proposed host-sites for the annual scientific meetings are (in no particular order): Bariloche, Argentina (in collaboration with the Centro Atómico Bariloche & Instituto Balseiro), Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico (in collaboration with UAM Iztapalapa), Santiago, Chile (in collaboration with Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile). The Executive Committee will work with each of these host-sites to provide an affordable venue and accommodation for attendees.

The registration fee for attendance at the Latin American Chapter annual scientific meeting will be at a reduced rate for any ISMRM Member. To promote collaboration with other ISMRM Chapters and the general ISMRM community, the Executive Committee will liaise with the ISMRM Central Office and the ISMRM Annual Meeting

Program Committee (AMPC) to organize an evening networking event at the ISMRM Annual meeting akin to other Chapters events. This event will be open to everyone attending ISMRM, including exhibitors. The Executive Committee will also liaise with the ISMRM Central Office and AMPC to organize a business meeting during the ISMRM Annual Meeting regular sessions, to present the newly elected Executive Committee members, give the annual report to the Chapter’s members, and conduct any other vote required by its members.

The Latin American Chapter will enhance the benefits of ISMRM membership by encouraging the members of the chapter to participate in activities of ISMRM as well as volunteer to serve in the ISMRM committees where they are eligible.

The Executive Committee will actively solicit sponsorship of the chapter’s annual meetings for travel stipends and educational awards.

# 4\. Finances

The Inaugural Executive Committee will not incur any direct expenses in this period. Indirect expenses (such as webpage hosting, or other services) should come as donations from institutional sponsorships.

Membership fees will be waived for all membership types during the inaugural period. The first elected Executive Committee will decide on membership fees for the subsequent 3-year period.

The Inaugural Executive Committee will work towards registering the Latin American Chapter as a non-profit organization and setting up a bank account. The legal residence of the Chapter will be in Santiago, Chile.

The Executive Committee will actively seek institutional sponsorship from local and foreign institutions to ensure its proper functioning and to work towards the successful execution of its goals. This includes the creation of a stipend program to promote the attendance of researchers and students from financially challenged regions at the Chapter’s and ISMRM activities.
